## Interactive TV Project
An interactive television is displayed on the screen. It has two buttons, one to power the television and one to flip to a different channel. Clicking the power button turns the television on and off. Clicking the channel button brings up a bouncing ball that is contained within the screen's limitations.

## Joke Movie Poster Project
This project is a comedic take on a movie poster for a potential Halloween sequel, making fun of how often the villain comes back to life. The poster displays the title of the movie along with some additional text describing the cast. Two altered images of the characters are shown. Upon clicking in the canvas, the text changes from light red to dark red. It changes back and forth whenever the user clicks.

## Webcam Project
This project makes use of the user's webcam. Opening the project activates the webcam, displaying whatever is in front of it. There is text below the webcam feed that tells the user to type a number. Below that is an input box where the user can type a number, which results in whichever number that is typed to be printed in the console.
